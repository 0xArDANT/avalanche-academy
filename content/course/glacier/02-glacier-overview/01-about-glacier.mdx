## What is the Glacier API?

The Glacier API provides Web3 developers with multi-chain data from Avalanche's primary network and Avalanche L1s. With Glacier, you can easily build products that leverage real-time and historical transaction data, transfer history, native and token balances, and various types of token metadata. The API is currently in Beta and may be subject to changes.

### API Features
- **Transactions and UTXOs** - Easily retrieve details related to transactions, UTXOs, and token transfers from Avalanche's EVM chains, including the P-Chain, X-Chain, and C-Chain.
- **Blocks** - Retrieve the latest blocks and block details.
- **Balances** - Fetch balances of native, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens along with relevant metadata.
- **Tokens** - Augment your user experience with detailed asset information.
- **Staking** - Get staking-related data for active and historical validators.

## AvaCloud SDK Integration

The [AvaCloud SDK](https://developers.avacloud.io/avacloud-sdk/getting-started) simplifies interactions with the Glacier API, enabling developers to easily integrate multi-chain data into their applications.

The AvaCloud SDK is currently available in _TypeScript_.

### How It Works
- **API Access**: By using the AvaCloud SDK, you can directly interact with Glacierâ€™s API endpoints to fetch real-time data like transaction histories, token balances, and asset metadata.
- **TypeScript Integration**: The SDK is designed to work seamlessly with TypeScript, providing strong typing and ease of use when making API calls.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: With just a few lines of code, you can fetch complex data structures, such as block details, staking information, and transfer records, simplifying the process of integrating blockchain data into your apps.
- **Error Handling and Security**: The SDK includes built-in error handling and optimizes security protocols, helping developers build robust applications on top of Avalanche's Primary Network and L1s.

Using the AvaCloud SDK, developers can accelerate their development process while building advanced Web3 applications that utilize multi-chain data from the Glacier API.
