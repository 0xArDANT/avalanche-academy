In this section we will use the Glacier Data API to create a simple web app that displays a user's ERC-20 token portfolio. This app will allow users to input their Ethereum address and view a list of their ERC-20 token balances.

We will use two endpoints from the Glacier Data API to accomplish this:

- `data.evm.blocks.getLatestBlocks`
- `data.evm.balances.listErc20Balances`
