There will be two main files that we will be working with in this section. 

### `Page.tsx`
This is the code that will be rendered on the client side, as distinguished by `"use client";` at the top of the file. It contains the React components that will be displayed to the user and is responsible for making the API calls to our backend which in turn calls the Glacier Data API.

It is important to understand that when you `"use client"` in a NextJS project, it will be rendered on the client side. This means that the code will be executed in the user's browser and not on the server. This is important to keep in mind when working with sensitive data or when you want to keep your API keys secure.

Besides this, we have two main functions that we will be working with in this file:
```tsx title="src/app/balance-app/page.tsx"
const handleSetAddress = async () => {
    const addressInput = document.getElementById("address") as HTMLInputElement;
    const address = addressInput.value;
    const addressPattern = /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/;  

    if (addressInput && addressPattern.test(address)) {
      setAddress(address);
      setBalances(await fetchERC20Balances(address));
    }
  };
```
`handleSetAddress` is a simple function that will be called when the user clicks the "Set Address" button. It will ensure the address is valid then set the inputed address to the React State. Next we call our next function `fetchERC20Balances` to get the user's balance.


```tsx title="src/app/balance-app/page.tsx"
 const fetchERC20Balances = async (address: string) => {
    const blockResult = await fetch("api/balance?method=getBlockHeight");
    const blockNumber = await blockResult.json();
    const balanceResult = await fetch("api/balance?method=listErc20Balances&address=" + address + "&blockNumber=" + blockNumber);
    const balances = await balanceResult.json();
    return balances as Erc20TokenBalance[];
  };
```

`fetchERC20Balances` is a function that will make a call to our backend to get the user's ERC-20 token balances. It will first get the current block height, then call the `listErc20Balances` method on our backend with the user's address and the block height. It will then return the balances as an array of `Erc20TokenBalance` objects.

### `Route.ts`
This code will be executed on the server side, as distinguished by `"use server";` at the top of the file. It contains the code that will be executed on the server side and is responsible for making the API calls to the Glacier Data API.

There are a few key components to understand in this file:
```tsx title="src/app/api/balance/route.ts"
import { AvaCloudSDK} from "@avalabs/avacloud-sdk";
const avaCloudSDK = new AvaCloudSDK({
    apiKey: process.env.GLACIER_API_KEY,
    chainId: "43114", // Avalanche Mainnet
    network: "mainnet",
  });
```
Here we initialize the `AvaCloudSDK` with our Glacier API key and the chainId of `43114` for the Avalanche Mainnet. This will allow us to make calls to the Glacier Data API.

```tsx title="src/app/api/balance/route.ts"
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const method = searchParams.get('method')
  try {
    let result
    switch (method) {
      case 'getBlockHeight':

        //
        // Implement Glacier Data API logic here and set it to result
        //

        result = result.result.blocks[0].blockNumber
        break
      case 'listErc20Balances':
        const address: string = searchParams.get('address')!
        const blockNumber: string = searchParams.get('blockNumber')!

        //
        // Implement Glacier Data API logic here and set it to result
        //

        // Compile the pages of results into a single array of balances
        const balances: Erc20TokenBalance[] = [];
        for await (const page of result) {
            balances.push(...page.result.erc20TokenBalances);
        }
        result = balances
        break
      default:
        return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid method' }, { status: 400 })
    }
    
    return NextResponse.json(result)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SDK error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

Here we define the internal API methods for our backend. We have two methods that we will be working with in this course: `getBlockHeight` and `listErc20Balances`.
We create both of these methods internally then forward the request to the Glacier Data API. We then return the result to the client.
