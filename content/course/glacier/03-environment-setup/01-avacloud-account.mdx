## Get a Glacier API Key

In order to utilize your accounts rate limits, you will need to make API requests with an API key. You can generate API Keys from the [AvaCloud portal](https://app.avacloud.io/glacier-api/).

<Steps>

<Step>
Create an account on [AvaCloud](https://avacloud.io).
</Step>

<Step>
Click on the **["Web3 Data API" tab](https://app.avacloud.io/glacier-api/)**.

</Step>

<Step>
Click **"+ Add API Key"** and create a new name for your API key.

</Step>

<Step>
**Save your API key** in a secure location. We will need it later

</Step>

</Steps>

After generating the API keys the AvaCloud page should look like this:
![](/course-images/glacier/final-api-key.png)

Once you've created and retrieved that, you will be able to make authenticated queries by passing in your API key in the x-glacier-api-key header of your HTTP request.

An example curl request to Glacier Data API:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: Application/json" -H "x-glacier-api-key: <your_api_key>" \
  "https://glacier-api.avax.network/v1/chains"
```
