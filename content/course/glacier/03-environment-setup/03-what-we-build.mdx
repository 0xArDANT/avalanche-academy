Once your environment is set up, we can start building some applications using Glacier and the AvaCloudSDK. The home page should look like this:

We will be building a few different applications in this course. Here is a brief overview of what we will be building:

- ERC-20 Balance App
- Wallet Portfolio App
- Block Explorer App

Each of these applications will utilize the Glacier Data API to get data from the Avalanche network. We will be fetch data such as ERC-20 token balances, NFT balances, recent transactions from an address, block information and much more.
