**IMAGES NEED UPDATE FOR GLACIER CODESPACE**


The Glacier Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Glacier. 

In this course we will run the Glacier Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the most quick way to get started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open the Glacier Starter Kit Github Repository:

<Link
    href="https://github.com/ava-labs/glacier-starter-kit"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Glacier Starter Kit</Link>

</Step>
<Step>

### Create a Codespace
- Click the green **Code** button
- Switch to the **Codespaces** tab
- Click **Create Codespace on main** or if you already have a Codespace click the plus (**+**) button

The Codespace will open in a new tab. Wait a few minutes until it's fully built.

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

Now install the yarn packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

Now we can run the NextJS app in hot reload mode:
    
```bash
yarn dev
```

</Step>
<Step>



### Optional: Open Codespace locally in Visual Studio Code

You can switch any time from the browser IDE to Visual Studio Code:

The first time you switch, you will be asked to install the [Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) and connect VS Code to you GitHub account, if it is not already connceted.
