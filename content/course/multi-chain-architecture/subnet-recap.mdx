# Custom Blockchains and Validator Subsets in Avalanche

An Avalanche Custom Blockchain is a sovereign network that defines its own rules for membership and token economics. It's validated by a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to achieve consensus on the blockchain's state.

## Key Concepts

- Custom Blockchain: A unique blockchain within the Avalanche ecosystem.
- Validator Subset: A group of validators responsible for a specific blockchain or set of blockchains.
- Subnet: A subset of validators united to validate one or more blockchains.

## Relationship Between Blockchains and Subnets

- Each blockchain is validated by exactly one Subnet.
- A Subnet can validate multiple blockchains.
- A validator may participate in multiple Subnets.

## The Primary Network

Avalanche's three main blockchains form the Primary Network:

- Platform Chain (P-Chain)
- Contract Chain (C-Chain)
- Exchange Chain (X-Chain)

These blockchains are validated and secured by all Avalanche validators, which collectively form a special Subnet known as the Primary Network.

Important: By definition, all validators participating in custom blockchain Subnets must also validate the Avalanche Primary Network.

## Independence and Scalability

Custom blockchains and their associated Subnets operate independently:

- They specify their own execution logic.
- They determine their own fee structures.
- They maintain their own state.
- They facilitate their own networking.
- They provide their own security.

## This independence ensures that custom blockchains don't share execution threads, storage, or networking with other Subnets or the Primary Network. As a result, the Avalanche network can:

- Scale up easily
- Enable lower latency
- Achieve higher transactions per second (TPS)
- Offer lower transaction costs

By leveraging custom blockchains and Subnets, Avalanche creates a flexible and scalable ecosystem that can adapt to a wide range of use cases and requirements.
