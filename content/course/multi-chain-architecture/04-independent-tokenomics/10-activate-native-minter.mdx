Ok, let's see how we can enable the native token minting rights. When prompted if you want to add a custom precompile, select **Yes**.

```bash
? Advanced: Would you like to add a custom precompile to modify the EVM?: 
    No
  ▸ Yes
    Go back to previous step
```

Next press enter when the Native Minter precompile is selected:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ← 
? Choose precompile: 
  ▸ Native Minting
    Contract Deployment Allow List
    Transaction Allow List
    Manage Fee Settings
    RewardManagerConfig
    Cancel
```

Let's add an address as an admin for our native token minting:

```bash
? Configure native minting admin addresses: 
  ▸ Add
    Delete
    Preview
    More Info
↓   Done
```

Now enter this address and confirm with enter: `0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`

Feel free to add more addresses here. Note that every address added here is an Admin. After setting all the admin addresses, go to done and press enter.

```bash
? Configure native minting admin addresses: 
    Add
    Delete
    Preview
    More Info
↓ ▸ Done
```

Now it will ask you to add the Managers and Enabled addresses. There are three levels of permissions for precompiles. You will learn more about this in upcoming chapters.

Feel free to add any addresses or just skip both by going straight to done.
