Many chains have a hard-capped supply for their gas token. The Avalanche C-Chain uses AVAX as their gas token and there will only ever be 720m AVAX. This may not be optimal for enterprise use cases, especially if they want to **create an experience with a valueless gas token**.

Therefore, they have the option to mint more native tokens at any time. This can be done through the **Native Minter Precompile**, that allows for fine-grained permissioning which address can mint more native tokens. These addresses are not necessarily owned by a single entity, but can also be managed by a multi-sig or DAO.

If a community running an Avalanche L1 wants to hard-cap the native token, that is perfectly doable as well. They just keep the native minter capabilities deactivated (which is the default).

```solidity title="Native Minter"
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface INativeMinter is IAllowList {
  event NativeCoinMinted(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

  // Mint [amount] number of native coins and send to [addr]
  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;
}

interface IAllowList {
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Enabled addresses can mint native tokens
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;  

  // Admins can mint native tokens and enable/disable addresses
  function setManager(address addr) external;
  
  // Admins can mint native tokens and enable/disable addresses and give/revoke manager and admin rights
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Revoke the role from that address
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

There can be rich permissioning structures around precompiles with three roles:

In the upcoming chapter, we will only use an admin address in order to keep the exercide simple.
