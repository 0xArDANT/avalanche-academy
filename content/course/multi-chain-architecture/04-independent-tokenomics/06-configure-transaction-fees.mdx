Alright, let's get to configuring our gas fees. When prompted select **Customize fee config**.

```bash
? How would you like to set fees: 
    Low disk use    / Low Throughput    1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)
    Medium disk use / Medium Throughput 2 mil   gas/s
    High disk use   / High Throughput   5 mil   gas/s
  ▸ Customize fee config
    Go back to previous step
```

Let's assume we are creating an enterprise blockchain with very few computationally intensive transactions. Our goal is:

- Allow very computationally expensive operations. The gas limit of the C-Chain is set to 8,000,000 gwei. Let's pick a number higher than that.
- Target producing one block every 10 seconds
- The same minimum transaction base fee as the C-Chain (25000000000wei = 25 gwei)
- Only slowly adjust the fee. The base fee change denominator of the C-Chain is 36.
- Have every block cost at least 500,000 gwei and at most 1,000,000 gwei
- Adjust the block gas cost same as the C-Chain (value 200000)
- When completely configured it should look something like this:

```bash
✔ Customize fee config
Customizing fee config
Set gas limit: 15000000
Set target block rate: 10
Set min base fee: 25000000000
Set target gas: 15000000
Set base fee change denominator: 50
Set min block gas cost: 500000
Set max block gas cost: 1000000
✔ Set block gas cost step: 200000
```
