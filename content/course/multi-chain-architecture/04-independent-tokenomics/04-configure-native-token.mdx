Let's create a new Avalanche L1 and spend some more attention on how we can configure our gas token: `avalanche blockchain create mysubnet2`

Pick some ChainID different from your first subnet (e.g. 8888). Then choose a name for your native token.

```bash
@martineckardt ➜ /workspaces/avalanche-starter-kit (main) $ avalanche blockchain create mysubnet2
✔ Avalanche L1-EVM
✔ Use latest release version
creating genesis for subnet mysubnet2
Enter your subnet's ChainId. It can be any positive integer.
ChainId: 9999
Select a symbol for your subnet's native token
Token symbol: TOK
```

Now, we have configured our own token. In the next step we will look at the fees.
