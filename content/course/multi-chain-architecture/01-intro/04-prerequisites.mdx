1. This course is for people who understand the Avalanche basics. If you are not familiar with Avalanche Consensus, Virtual Machines, blockchains in Avalanche, or Avalanche Custom Blockchains, we strongly recommend taking our Avalanche Fundamentals course first.

2. You should have Core Wallet browser extension installed and know how to send funds, as well as change between networks and accounts.

3. You should have a general understanding the EVM and basic Solidity smart contracts, including deploying them via Remix using Core as the injected provider.
