This guide will walk you through the process of using a bridge between 2 Avalanche blockchains, providing a step-by-step approach to ensure a smooth and secure experience.

Go to (ohmywarp.com)[ohmywarp.com] and connect any web3 (wallet)[core.app]. Make sure your wallet has at least some AVAX in the Fuji testner, if you need funds you can go to the (faucet)[faucet.avax.network]
- Use the coupon code `avalanche-academy` to get AVAX in C-chain

Mint some TLP token on C-chain in the Mint tab. This is an ERC20 deployed on Fuji's C-chain.
Finally bridge some TLP to Dispatch. You can confirm the transfer in the Mint tab.
