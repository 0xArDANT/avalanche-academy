In this section, you will deploy mock receiver contracts on the Avalanche L1. You can choose to deploy either the `MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver` or the `MockNativeSendAndCallReceiver` contract depending your token type.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/mocks/MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver.sol:MockERC20SendAndCallReceiver
```

After deployment, save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable for future use.

```bash
export MOCK_RECEIVER_ADDRESS=<"Deployed to" address>
```

After successfully deploying the contract, move on to testing the mock receivers.
