Now that you have deployed the mock receiver contracts, it is time to test their functionality by sending tokens across Avalanche L1s.

Use the following command to send tokens to the mock receiver contract:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN "sendAndCall((bytes32, address, address, bytes, uint256, uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256), uint256)" "(${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_SUBNET}, ${MOCK_RECEIVER_ADDRESS}, 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 2500000, 2000000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0)" 100000000000000000000
```

### Verify the Results

Check the logs and emitted events to verify that the tokens were received correctly.
