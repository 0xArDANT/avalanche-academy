While deploying the wrapped exchange contract, you will need to send two constructor arguments to the contract.

- The first argument is the wrapped native token (WAVAX) address on the destination chain (Fuji), which is: [`0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c).
- The second argument is the Trader Joe's (or any other Uniswap V2-like dapp) Factory V1 contract address on the destination chain (Fuji), which is: [`0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C). Deployed contracts of TraderJoe can be found [here](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/deployment-addresses/fuji).

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc --private-key $PK src/interchain-token-transfer/4-send-and-call/DexERC20Wrapper.sol:DexERC20Wrapper --constructor-args 0xd00ae08403B9bbb9124bB305C09058E32C39A48c 0xF5c7d9733e5f53abCC1695820c4818C59B457C2C
```

Save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable.


```bash
export WRAPPED_EXCHANGE_ADDRESS=<"Deployed to" address>
```
