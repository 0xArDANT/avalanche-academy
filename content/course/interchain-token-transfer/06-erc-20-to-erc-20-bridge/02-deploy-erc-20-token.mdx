To transfer an ERC20 token from C-chain to your own blockchain, the fist thing we will need is the ERC20 token to bridge. You will find a contract in the Starter-Kit under src/8-erc20-to-erc20-interchain-token-transfer/ERC20.sol:TOK of the Starter-kit

```bash 
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK src/8-erc20-to-erc20-interchain-token-transfer/ERC20.sol:TOK
```

Save the `Deployed to` address in an environment variable

```bash
export ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN=<"Deployed to" address>
```

If you deployed the above example contract, you should see a balance of 100,000 tokens when you run the below command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```
