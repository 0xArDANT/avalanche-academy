## Transfer an ERC20 Token &rarr; Avalanche L1 as Native Token

The following example will show you how to send an ERC20 Token on C-chain to an Avalanche L1 as a native token using Teleporter and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network, but can be applied to Fuji Testnet and Avalanche Mainnet directly.

**All Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer contracts and interfaces implemented in this example implementation are maintained in the [avalanche-interchain-token-transfer](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

If you prefer full end-to-end testing written in Golang for bridging ERC20s, native tokens, or any combination of the two, you can view the test workflows directly in the [avalanche-interchain-token-transfer](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/tests/flows) repository.

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The avalanche-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we have to do

1. Create an Avalanche L1 and Deploy on Local Network
2. Deploy an ERC20 Contract on C-chain
3. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on C-chain and Avalanche L1
4. Register Remote Token with Home Transferer
5. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens
