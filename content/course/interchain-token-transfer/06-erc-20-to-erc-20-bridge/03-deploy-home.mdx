## Deploy Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer Contracts

We will deploy two Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer contracts. One of the source chain (which is C-chain in our case) and another on the destination chain (mysubnet in our case).

### ERC20Home Contract

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/contracts/src/TokenHome/ERC20TokenHome.sol:ERC20TokenHome --constructor-args $TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN $FUNDED_ADDRESS $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN 18
```

Export the "Deployed to" address as an environment variables.

```bash
export ERC20_HOME_TRANSFERER_C_CHAIN=<"Deployed to" address>
```
