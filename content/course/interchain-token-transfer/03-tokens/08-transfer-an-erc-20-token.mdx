## Deploy ERC-20

Let's deploy a basic demo ERC20 contract that comes integrated with the CLI on our Subnet.

```bash 
avalanche contract deploy erc20
```
and follow this configuration:
```bash 
✔ Local Network
✔ Subnet mysubnet
A private key is needed to pay for the contract deploy fees.
It will also be considered the owner address of the contract, beign able to call
the contract methods only available to owners.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ← 
? Which private key do you want to use to deploy the contract?: 
✔ Use the private key of the Genesis Allocated address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Which is the token symbol?
Token symbol: TOK
Which is the total token supply?
Token supply: 1000000
Which address should receive the supply?
✔ Use the Genesis Allocated address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC

Token Address: 0x52C84043CD9c865236f11d9Fc9F56aa003c1f922

ERC20 Contract Successfully Deployed!

Save the token Address in an environment variable.

```bash
export ERC20_CONTRACT_SUBNET=0x...
```

## Transfer ERC20 from your account to another.

Before transfering the assets you need to nake sure you have at least one extra account created so you can transfer funds to it:
```
avalanche key list -l --subnets mysubnet --tokens $ERC20_CONTRACT_SUBNET,native  --keys myKey,ewoq
```

you will get an output like this:

```bash

+--------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
|  KIND  | NAME  |  SUBNET  |                  ADDRESS                   |     TOKEN     |      BALANCE      |    NETWORK    |
+--------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
| stored | myKey | mysubnet | 0x302Ce9b6346E477ecb774aF73E908a4971B7ce2E | NAT (Native)  |                 0 | Local Network |
+        +       +          +--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
|        |       |          | 0x302Ce9b6346E477ecb774aF73E908a4971B7ce2E | TOK (0x52C8.) |                 0 | Local Network |
+        +-------+          +--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
|        | ewoq  |          | 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC | NAT (Native)  |  999999.984293650 | Local Network |
+        +       +          +--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
|        |       |          | 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC | TOK (0x52C8.) | 1000000.000000000 | Local Network |
+--------+-------+----------+--------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+
```

Now, lets transfer some TOK from the ewoq address to the myKey address.

```
cast send $ERC20_CONTRACT_SUBNET --value 0 --private-key $PK "transfer(address,uint256)" $MYKEY 200ether --rpc-url mysubnet
```

Notice how we are setting the value to 0 since the --value command works for sending the native token, and in this case we are really interacting with a function of the ERC20 standard called `transfer` and will be the one in charge of modifying the balances mapping in the TOK state. Notice the amount that transfer receives needs to be set in wei, except if you use the word ether to convert units automatically.

```

## Verify transfer

Again, you can verify the transfer was performed correctly by retrieving the balances of each token in the Subnet.

```bash
avalanche key list -l --subnets mysubnet --tokens $ERC20_CONTRACT_SUBNET,native  --keys myKey,ewoq
```
