## Deploy ERC-20


```bash

## Transfer ERC20 to a Smart Contracts
 To facilitate transfers, the approve and transferFrom functions are used. The approve function sets an allowance for a specified address, permitting it to withdraw up to a certain amount of tokens. The transferFrom function is then called by the allowed address to transfer tokens from the holder to another address or contract.

 While must of the functions are self explanatory, let's review how 'allowance' and 'approve' work since these two will play a crucial role for using an ERC20 token in conjunction of another smart contract such as receiving funds or our Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer contracts.
