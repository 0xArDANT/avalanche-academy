In this exercise, you will learn how to transfer native tokens on your own L1 in the Avalanche network using Foundry, a powerful toolkit for EVM application development. 

Start by creating and deploying a new blockchain using the Avalanche Starter Kit. With your chain up and running, let's transfer some native tokens from one account to another using Foundry

## Create a blockchain with the following configuration

```bash
avalanche subnet create mysubnet
```

```bash
✔ Subnet-EVM
✔ Use latest release version
✔ Yes
✔ Yes
Installing subnet-evm-v0.6.7...
subnet-evm-v0.6.7 installation successful
creating genesis for subnet mysubnet
Enter your subnet's ChainId. It can be any positive integer.
ChainId: 123
Select a symbol for your subnet's native token
Token symbol: NAT
✔ Low disk use    / Low Throughput    1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)
✔ Airdrop 1 million tokens to the default ewoq address (do not use in production)
prefunding address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC with balance 1000000000000000000000000
✔ No
✓ Successfully created subnet configuration
```

## Deploy blockchain on Local network

```
avalanche subnet deploy mysubnet
```

## Create account
```bash
avalanche key create myKey
```

Retrieve the new address with and store it in an environment variable to match the following commands.
 
```bash
 avalanche key list -l --subnets mysubnet --keys myKey
```

```bash
export $MYKEY=0x...
```

## Check balances

```bash
cast balance $MYKEY --rpc-url mysubnet
```

## Transfer funds

```
cast send $MYKEY --value 200000  --private-key $PK --rpc-url mysubnet
```

## Check balances to confirm transfer

```bash
cast balance $MYKEY --rpc-url mysubnet
```

As you saw, funds were transfered from one count to another within the same chain (mysubnet)
