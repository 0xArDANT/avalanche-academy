The token bridge also supports "multi-hop" transfers, where tokens can be transferred between spoke chains. To illustrate, consider two spokes _S<sub>a</sub>_ and _S<sub>b</sub>_ that are both connected to the same remote _H_. A multi-hop transfer from _S<sub>a</sub>_ to _S<sub>b</sub>_ first gets routed from _S<sub>a</sub>_ to _H_, where spoke balances are updated, and then _H_ automatically routes the transfer on to _S<sub>b</sub>_.
