## Avalanche

This course is intended for people with knowledge about Cross-Chain communication protocols, and a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. Avalanche Architecture: Be familiar with Avalanche blockchains.
2. Cross-Chain Messages: Know how to communicate 2 Avalanche blockchains with Teleporter. 

If some of this is not clear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals, Multi-Chain Architecture, and Interchain Messaging courses first.

## Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to be able to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

1. Solidity: Basic Knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces. 
2. Foundry: Familiarity with Foundry will help to deploy and interact with contracts.
