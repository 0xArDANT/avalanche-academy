In this course, you will learn how to build cross-Subnet Solidity dApps with Interchain Messaging and Avalanche Warp Messaging.

## Why Take This Course?

A significant innovation in blockchain is the development of multi-chain systems, like Avalanche, which provide a significant improvement in scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. At the core of these multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains that communicate. Each chain's VM is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.

Cross-chain communication is a crucial building block of multi-chain systems. Utilizing Interchain Messaging and Avalanche Warp Messaging is an incredible easy way to build cross-Subnet dApps, since developers can build on top an extensive and audited development framework. 

## Course Content

### Interoperability 

In the first section, we cover some basic concepts of interoperability in multi-chain systems. You will learn about examples of interoperability between blockchains and the terms "source," "destination," and "message."

### Avalanche Interchain Messaging

In this section, we learn what Avalanche Interchain Messaging is and what is abstracted away from the general dApp developer. You will also build your first cross-Subnet dApps.

### Securing Cross-Chain Communication

In this section, we look at techniques to secure cross-chain communication. We dive into signature schemes, multi-signature schemes, and the BLS multi-signature scheme.

### Avalanche Interchain Messaging Protocol

Avalanche blockchains can natively interoperate between one another using AWM. You will learn about the AWM message format and how the message flow works.
