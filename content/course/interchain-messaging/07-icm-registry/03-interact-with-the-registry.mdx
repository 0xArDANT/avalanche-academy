Let's start by interacting the registry. Registry is deployed on specific addresses depending the chain you're operating and the status of the network at the deployment time. For your local network you can find it out with the following command:

```bash
avalanche primary describe
avalanche subnet describe myblockchain
``` 

Let's put the address of the registry in an environment variable:

```bash
export C_CHAIN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x1234...
export MYBLOCKCHAIN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x5678...
```

Let's interact with the Registry by getting the latest version of the Interchain Messaging Messenger deployed on C-Chain:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $C_CHAIN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS "latestVersion()(uint256)" 
```
