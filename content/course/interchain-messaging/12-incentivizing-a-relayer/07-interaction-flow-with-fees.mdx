We have all the Smart Contract ðŸ“œ set we can start sending incentivized Cross-Chain messages. Now let complete the flow 

- Deploy sender contract on C-chain
- Deploy receiver contract on myblockchain
- Approve the sender contract to spend ERC20 funds from the message sender address
- Send the message

<Steps>
<Step>

### Deploy Sender Contract 

To deploy the sender contract run:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK src/9-incentivize-relayer/senderWithFees.sol:SenderWithFeesOnCChain
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Save the Sender Contract Address

```bash
export SENDER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Receiver Contract

Now, deploy the receiver contract.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK src/9-incentivize-relayer/receiverWithFees.sol:receiverWithFeesOnCChain
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Receiver Contract Address

```bash
export RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Approve ERC20 Token Expense

ðŸ‘© The Message Sender (User) requires to approve the Cross-Avalanche L1 dApp as a spender on the ERC20 contract to be used as fee. To do that lets use the function "approve" on our deployed FEE contract.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK ERC20_fee_address "approve(address,uint256)" SENDER_ADDRESS 500000000000000
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Send an incentivized message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address, string, address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS, "Hello", $ERC20_fee_address
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify message was received on Avalanche L1 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c RECEIVER_ADDRESS "lastMessage()(string)"
```

</Step>
</Steps>
