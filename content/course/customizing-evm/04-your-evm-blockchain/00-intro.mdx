In this part of our course, we'll explore how to run your own Avalanche Network with a custom EVM. Running your own EVM allows you to address specific use cases and highlights one of the key advantages of multi-chain systems over monolithic ones.

## Hands-On Exercise

In this section, you won't need to write any Go code. Instead, you'll run some commands to set up your EVM blockchain.

## Structure of This Section

We will cover the following topics:

- **Avalanche CLI**: Learn how to use this tool to create your own Avalanche Network and add Avalanche L1s and blockchains.
- **Token Transfer**: Discover how to perform token transfers with Foundry.

This practical exercise will help you consolidate your knowledge and see the impact of customizations on EVM performance firsthand.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you'll be equipped with the skills to effectively run your own Avalanche Network with a custom EVM blockchain, paving the way for your blockchain projects.
