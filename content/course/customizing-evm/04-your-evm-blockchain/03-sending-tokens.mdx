To make sure the the blockchain is up and running, let's make a simple token transfer to a random address `0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc` with foundry:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url mysubnet --private-key $PK 0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc --value 1ether
```

Now let's check if the transaction was successful:

```bash
cast balance --rpc-url mysubnet 0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc
```

You should see the balance of the address `0x321f6B73b6dFdE5C73731C39Fd9C89c7788D5EBc` as `1`.
