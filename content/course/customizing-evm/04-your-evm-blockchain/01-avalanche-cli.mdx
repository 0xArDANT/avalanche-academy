## What is the Avalanche CLI?

Avalanche-CLI is a command-line tool that provides developers with comprehensive access to Avalanche functionalities. It is designed to help developers build and test their independent blockchains.

Each Avalanche network includes a Primary Network, which comprises a Contract (C), Platform (P), and Exchange (X) chain. Note that the term "Primary Network" is somewhat misleading, as it refers to a special Avalanche L1 rather than a distinct network.

Your local network is completely independent of the Mainnet or Fuji Testnet. You can even operate an Avalanche Network offline. Local Avalanche networks support, but are not limited to, the following commands:

- **Start and Stop a Network**: Start and stop a local network.
- **Health Check**: Provide information on the health of each node in the network.
- **Create Blockchains**: Create a new blockchain using specified parameters.

Managing a local network with multiple nodes can be complex. To simplify this, the Avalanche CLI includes user-friendly commands.

## Usage

The Precompile-EVM repository pre-loads Avalanche CLI along with Foundry, so you donâ€™t need to install any additional tools to start building within Codespaces. Simply use the terminal in your Codespace to run Avalanche CLI commands.
