In this tutorial, we'll create a simple blockchain network and deploy it on the local Avalanche Network.

For convenience, the private key `56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027` of the default airdrop address is stored in the environment variable `$PK`. Furthermore, the RPC URL for the C-Chain of your local network is set in the `foundry.toml` file.

## Configuration

To get started, create a new configuration named `mysubnet`:

```bash
avalanche subnet create mysubnet
```

Next, follow the steps one-by-one as highlighted by the CLI. Below is an example configuration of our blockchain network.

```bash
? Choose your VM:
✔ Subnet-EVM
? What version of Subnet-EVM would you like?:
✔ Use latest release version
? Would you like to enable Teleporter on your VM?:
✔ Yes
? Would you like to run AMW Relayer when deploying your VM?:
✔ Yes
Installing subnet-evm-v0.6.4...
subnet-evm-v0.6.4 installation successful
creating genesis for subnet mysubnet
Enter your subnet's ChainId. It can be any positive integer.
ChainId: 12345
Select a symbol for your subnet's native token
Token symbol: ASH
? How would you like to set fees:
✔ Low disk use    / Low Throughput    1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)
? How would you like to distribute funds:
✔ Airdrop 1 million tokens to the default ewoq address (do not use in production)
prefunding address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC with balance 1000000000000000000000000
? Advanced: Would you like to add a custom precompile to modify the EVM?:
✔ No
✓ Successfully created subnet configuration
```

## Deployment

Finally, it's time to deploy our blockchain on the Local Network:

```bash
avalanche subnet deploy mysubnet
? Choose a network for the operation:
✔ Local Network
Deploying [mysubnet] to Local Network
```

You'll see the following output:

```
