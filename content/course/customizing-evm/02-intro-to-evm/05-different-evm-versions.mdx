## Geth

Geth (or [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)) is the official implementation of an Ethereum client, written in the Go programming language. It is one of the original and most widely used Ethereum clients today. Geth handles transactions, deploys and executes smart contracts, and contains the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Coreth

[Coreth](https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth) is a fork of Geth maintained by Ava Labs that implements the Virtual Machine for the C-Chain. It has been adapted to work with Avalanche Consensus.

## Subnet-EVM

[Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) is a fork of Coreth designed to make it easy to launch customized EVM-based blockchains on an Avalanche L1. It differs from Coreth in the following ways:

&rarr; **Configurable fees and gas limits added in the genesis file**

&rarr; **Avalanche hardforks merged into a single "Subnet-EVM" hardfork**

&rarr; **Atomic transactions and shared memory removed**

&rarr; **Multicoin contracts and state removed**

## Precompile-EVM

Precompile-EVM allows precompiles to be registered with Subnet-EVM without forking the Subnet-EVM codebase. This simplifies common customizations to Subnet-EVM, making them more accessible and easier to maintain. It also streamlines updates for Subnet-EVM.
