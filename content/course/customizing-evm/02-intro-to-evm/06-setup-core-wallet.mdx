## Managing MetaMask and Core Extensions

If you've added both Metamask and Core Wallet to your browser, you could face some problems. But to fix them, you don't need to remove Metamask. Just follow the below steps to disable the Metamask extension:

1. Open the extensions page in your browser. You can also type `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar and press enter.
2. Scroll through your list of installed extensions, or use the search bar at the top of the page, to find the Metamask extension.
3. Once you find Metamask, you will see a toggle switch next to it. Click on this switch to disable the extension.

When the switch is in the off position, Metamask is disabled, and you should be all set.
