In this part of our course, we will explore how to optimize your EVM for specific use cases through chain configuration. Tailoring EVM configurations to fit specific use cases is a key advantage of multi-chain systems.

## Exercise

In this section, you won’t need to write any Go code. Instead, we’ll adjust values in the JSON file of the genesis block.

## Structure of This Section

We will cover the following topics:

- **Genesis Block**: The cornerstone of any blockchain. We’ll provide an overview of its components and how its properties can be customized.
- **Fee Configuration**: Learn how to balance incentivizing validators with ensuring economic feasibility for users. This is crucial in a public network to manage congestion and discourage wasteful transactions.
- **Initial Token Allocation**: Understand how to specify the initial distribution of tokens in your custom EVM to set your network up for success.
- **Preinstalled Precompiles**: Discover how to configure preinstalled precompiles to leverage powerful functionalities, such as restricting who can issue transactions or deploy contracts to your chain.

Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to run a local EVM with a custom Genesis Block. This exercise will help you consolidate your learnings and see the impact of customizations on EVM performance firsthand.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you will be equipped to customize the EVM in Avalanche effectively, unlocking a range of possibilities for your blockchain projects. Let’s dive into the world of EVM customization and chain configuration together!
