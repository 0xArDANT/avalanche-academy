## What is ThunderClient

Thunder Client is a lightweight, fast HTTP client extension for Visual Studio Code, designed as an alternative to applications like Postman for sending HTTP requests.

## Installation

Head over to the Visual Studio Marketplace and install the extension. Alternatively you can search for it in the **Extensions** tab of VS Code: [ThunderClient](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client)

## Importing the Avalanche Academy Collection

We provide a collection of requests, so you do not have to enter all of these yourself. Head to the **Collections** tab and click the symbol with three lines next to the search bar. There, click **Import from URL**.

Paste the following URL in the input that appears: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm/avalanche-academy-start/.vscode/avalanche-academy-thunder-collection.json

## Verify

You should now see a collection called **Avalanche Academy - Customize the EVM** in your collections tab. When you click on it, you should see multiple requests in some folders.
