## Connecting to a Local Blockchain

In order to interact with our new Blockchain, we need to connect a wallet. Wallets communicate with the blockchain through one of the nodes. To connect a wallet to the blockchain, we need to provide the following information:

- Network RPC URL
- Network Name
- Chain ID
- Token Symbol

## RPC URLs

Each node provides an RPC endpoint for its Blockchains. When you create a transaction, click on send and sign it, which causes it to be sent to the specified RPC URL of your blockchain by your wallet.

An RPC URL could look something like this: http://127.0.0.1:9654/ext/bc/2YUr8sULVTm25EDFNDUwxnwk73enuqhkci4yXzoAgJYEjQ2HuC/rpc

Let's dissect this URL: `http://<node_ip>:<node_port>/ext/bc/<blockchain_id>/rpc`

**&rarr; node_ip:** The IP of the node. Since we are testing locally, all of our nodes share the same IP 127.0.0.1 which equals to localhost, meaning it is always the current machine.

**&rarr; node_port:** Each Machine requires a unique port, so send and receive network data. The default port is 9650. Since we are are running 5 nodes locally, they are run on different ports. Uneven port numbers are skipped.

**&rarr; blockchain_id:** Each Blockchain has a unique id. Because a node validates multiple chains, we have to specify in the url which blockchain we want to submit the transaction to.

## RPC URLs for Codespaces

Since we are running our Avalanche network on Github Cloud while using Codespaces, localhost refers to the machine in the cloud. Therefore, we need to take few extra steps.

### 1. Publish Ports

First, let's instruct the codespace to make the port available to everyone on the internet. Find the port 9650, right-click the entry, and set the **Port Visibility** to **Public**.

### 2. Get URL

Next, right-click the same row and click **Copy Local Address**.

This will give us something like: `https://obscure-succotash-pjr7qxv9q6gh696v-9650.app.github.dev/`

This is equivalent to `localhost:9650` if we were running the network on our local machine. Now, we have to add the rest of the URL (`/ext/bc/<BLOCKCHAIN_ID>/rpc`), 
so we will end up with something like this: `https://obscure-succotash-pjr7qxv9q6gh696v-9650.app.github.dev/ext/bc/2YUr8sULVTm25EDFNDUwxnwk73enuqhkci4yXzoAgJYEjQ2HuC/rpc`

Follow these steps to create the RPC URLs for one of the Avalanche nodes running in your own codespace.

## Add Network to Core

Now, open the Core browser extension and navigate from there to the screen to add a new network.

Now, enter the RPC URL for your network and append **/rpc** to it: `http://127.0.0.1:<node_port>/ext/bc/<your_blockchain_id>/rpc`

Also, add the following information:

- **Network Name**: Pick an arbitrary name, such as MyChain
- **ChainID**: Use the number you assigned at the top of your Genesis JSON file
- **Token Symbol**: Any symbol name for your native gas token, such as TOK

Hit **Save** and make sure to **switch** to the newly created Network.

## Send Tokens

Go ahead and send some tokens to your other account by clicking the **circle with the plus** and then **Send**. From there, click on icon in the address field and switch to the tab **My Account** to select another of you accounts.

While sending the tokens, reflect on how this is influenced by:

- the initial token allocation you have set
- the gas fees you have set
