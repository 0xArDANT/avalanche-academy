The internet, as we know it today, is built on a centralized architecture, where data and services are controlled and maintained by a few large entities like data centers and internet service providers. However, the advent of blockchain technologies has opened up new possibilities for a more decentralized internet, often referred to as Web 3.0 or the decentralized web.

## Moving from a centralized Entity to a Collective of Validators

Blockchain systems achieve decentralization through the use of a network of validators, sometimes referred to as nodes, miners, or stakers, depending on the underlying consensus mechanism. Validators are responsible for verifying and securing transactions, maintaining the integrity of the blockchain, and ensuring that the system remains decentralized and trustless. Decentralization is achieved by distributing the responsibility of maintaining the network across numerous independent participants.
