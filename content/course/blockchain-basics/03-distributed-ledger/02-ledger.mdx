A ledger is a transparent record of all state changes. Let's look at how bank accounts are implemented: Your bank does not only know what amount your balance is, but also how it developed over time. It records every change of your balance, such as:

- Outgoing transfers
- Incoming transfers
- Interest 

If you every doubted that your account balance is correct, your bank could prove to you exactly how it calculated it. 

## Fixed Order

For fixed-order append-only ledgers the order of transactions are fixed. That means that after a transaction has been added to the ledger it cannot be changed, removed or moved. 

If the effects of a transaction should be reverted, because if was for example added by mistake, another transaction reversing the effect needs to be issued. Let's say you received a payment by mistake. Instead of removing the transaction, another transaction transfering the funds back would be added.

## Blocks

To not reason about small incremental state changes, the concepts of blocks was introduced. A block groups a ordered set of transactions. Instead of adding transactions one-by-one to the ledger we first collect them in a pool and once we collected a few we create a block and add it to the ledger.

Apart from the transactions, the block also contains a reference to the previous block. This implements the append-only property.
