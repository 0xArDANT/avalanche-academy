Alright, now let's send the message:

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS
```

## Verify Message Receipt

To check wether the message has been received, we can call the `roundtripMessage()` function on the sender contract. 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c $SENDER_ADDRESS "roundtripMessage()(string)"
```

To understand in more detail what happened, check out the relayer logs:

```bash
avalanche teleporter relayer logs
```
