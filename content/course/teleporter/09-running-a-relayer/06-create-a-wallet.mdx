Since our AWM Relayer will submit the incoming warp messages as transactions on the destination Subnet, it will need to have a wallet with the native gas token to sign these transactions. It is best practice to create a new wallet for your relayer. The private key will be needed as part of your relayer's config file.

You can create this wallet however you like. One way to create a wallet is using foundry's `cast` command:

```bash
cast wallet new
```

<Callout type="warn">Never use this wallet outside of this testing environment. Do not store any funds of real value in this wallet.</Callout>
