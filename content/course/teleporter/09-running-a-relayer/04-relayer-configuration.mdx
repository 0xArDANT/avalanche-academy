A relayer is configured to relayer messages between certain source and destination Subnets. Therefore, the configuration consists of three parts:
- **General Config:** Configuration independent of the source and destination Subnets concerning the network as a whole
- **Source Blockchain Configs:** All parameters necessary for the relayer to pick up the messages 
- **Destination Blockchain Configs:** All parameters necessary to deliver the messages

The configuration is supplied to the relayer as a JSON file. Let's open the one automatically created for the Avalanche-CLI relayer:

```bash
code ~/.avalanche-cli/runs/awm-relayer-config.json 
```

Let's go through the different values:

## General Config

The general config contains among others the following parameters:

```json
{
  "p-chain-api": {
    "base-url": "http://127.0.0.1:9650",
    "query-parameters": {},
    "http-headers": null
  },
  "info-api": {
    "base-url": "http://127.0.0.1:9650",
    "query-parameters": {},
    "http-headers": null
  	},  
   	// ...
}
```

- **info-api-url:** The URL of the [Info API](https://docs.avax.network/reference/avalanchego/info-api) node to which the relayer will connect to to receive information like the NetworkID.
- **p-chain-api-url:** The URL of the Avalanche [P-Chain API](https://docs.avax.network/reference/avalanchego/p-chain/api) node to which the relayer will connect to query the validator sets. 

## Source Blockchain Configs

Next is the configuration for our source blockchain. This is the configuration of the blockchain where messages will be initiated and picked up. The relayer will aggregate the signatures of the validators of that Subnet. 

```json
{
  // General Config ...

  "source-blockchains": [
	{
      "subnet-id": "11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY",
      "blockchain-id": "epm5fG6Pn1Y5rBHdTe36aZYeLqpXugreyHLZB5dV81rVTs7Ku",
      "vm": "evm",
      "rpc-endpoint": {
        "base-url": "http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/epm5fG6Pn1Y5rBHdTe36aZYeLqpXugreyHLZB5dV81rVTs7Ku/rpc",
        "query-parameters": null,
        "http-headers": null
      },
      "ws-endpoint": {
        "base-url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/epm5fG6Pn1Y5rBHdTe36aZYeLqpXugreyHLZB5dV81rVTs7Ku/ws",
        "query-parameters": null,
        "http-headers": null
      },
      "message-contracts": {
        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000": {
          "message-format": "off-chain-registry",
          "settings": {
            "teleporter-registry-address": "0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25"
          }
        },
        "0x253b2784c75e510dD0fF1da844684a1aC0aa5fcf": {
          "message-format": "teleporter",
          "settings": {
            "reward-address": "0xbAE6Ff34d6Da45128C1ddFEDA008e55A328f5665"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]

  // Destination Blockchains
}
```

- **subnet-id:** The Subnet ID of the Subnet that the source blockchain is part of. In this example this is the Subnet ID of the Primary Network.
- **blockchain-id:** The blockchain ID of the source. In this example this is the blockchain ID of Fuji's C-Chain.
- **vm:** A string specifying the virtual machine of the destination Subnet's blockchain. Currently, only the EVM is supported, but this field has been added in anticipation of communication between blockchains powered by different virtual machines in the future.
- **rpc-endpoint:** An API Config containing:
<div class="pl-6">
- **base-url:** RPC endpoint of the destination subnet's API node.
- **query-parameters:** Additional query parameters to include in the API requests
- **http-headers:** Additional HTTP headers to include in the API requests
</div>
- **wss-endpoint:** An API Config containing:
<div class="pl-6">
- **base-url**: The WebSocket endpoint of the source subnet's API node
- **query-parameters:** Additional query parameters to include in the API requests
- **http-headers:** Additional HTTP headers to include in the API requests
</div>
- **message-contracts:** A map of contract addresses to the config options of the protocol (e.g. Teleporter) at that address. Each MessageProtocolConfig consists of a unique message-format name, and the raw JSON settings. "0x253b2784c75e510dD0fF1da844684a1aC0aa5fcf" is the address of the TeleporterMessenger on the Fuji C-Chain.
<div class="pl-6">
- **message-format:** should be set to Teleporter. Additional message formats next to teleporter may be developed in the future 
- **settings > reward-address:** The address that will be rewarded if a Subnet is incentivizing relayers to send messages on it's behalf. This is the address of the wallet you will create for this relayer.
