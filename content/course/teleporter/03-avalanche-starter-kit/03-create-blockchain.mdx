In order to send messages between two chains, we need to create a blockchain. In this guide, we will spin up a local Avalanche network that has it's own Primary Network (C-, P- and X-Chain) using the Avalanche CLI. Furthermore, we will create a blockchain in that Avalanche network, so we can send messages between the C-Chain and the newly created blockchain in the next chapters.
