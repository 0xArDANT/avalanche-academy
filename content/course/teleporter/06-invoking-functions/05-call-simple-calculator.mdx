Alright, now let's call our Calculators:

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendAddMessage(address, uint256, uint256)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS 2 3
```

## Verify Message Receipt

To check wether the message has been received, we can call the `result_num()` function on the sender contract. 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url mysubnet $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "result_num()(uint)"
```
