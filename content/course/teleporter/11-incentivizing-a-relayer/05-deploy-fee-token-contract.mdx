To add incentives for a relayer we need to specify the ERC20 contract we will be incentivizing with. Since we are working with an almost clean network deployed locally, we will need to first deploy this contract to later use it as the incentive token. 

## Deploy and Mint ERC20 

Incentives are set with ERC20 tokens deployed on the Source chain, in this case our local C-chain. While this token can be a wrapped version of the native token, for this example we will be using just a simple ERC20 included as demo in the Avalanche-CLI. Let's deploy and mint some of these FEE tokens to later be used to incentivize the relayer.

To deploy your FEE Token contract run:

```bash
avalanche contract deploy erc20
```
This command will deploy a demo ERC20. Add the following configuration

```bash
✔ Use the private key of the Genesis Allocated address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Which is the token symbol?
Token symbol: FEE
Which is the total token supply?
Token supply: 100000
Which address should receive the supply?
✔ Use the Genesis Allocated address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
```

Save the ERC20 address in an environment address

```bash
export ERC20_fee_address=0x...
```
