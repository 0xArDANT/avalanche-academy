## Why Take This Course?
A significant innovation in blockchain is the development of multi-chain systems, like Avalanche, which provide a significant improvement in scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. At the core of these multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains that with customized VMs. Each chain's VM is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.

## Prerequisites

### Avalanche
This course is meant for people with a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

- **Virtual Machines:** What they are and what VM customization means
- **Avalanche L1s & Blockchains:** What the difference between a VM, Blockchain, and an Avalanche L1 is

If any of this is unclear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals and Multi-Chain Architecture courses first.

### Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

- **Golang:** Familiarity with most concepts of the language. All exercises will mainly consist of writing Golang code.
- **Docker:** The advanced exercises in the latter part of the course will occur in contained environments for easy setup. It will help if you're generally familiar with the concept of containerization, docker, and docker compose.
- **Testing:** Having some experience or familiarity with unit testing is ideal.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

- ...

Overall, this course aims to provide an advanced understanding of HyperSDK. By completing this course, students will be better prepared to build advanced blockchain applications.
