Each bridge instance consists of one "hub" contract and at least one but possibly many "spoke" contracts. Each hub contract instance manages one asset to be bridged out to spoke instances. The hub contract lives on the Subnet where the asset to be bridged exists and locks that asset as collateral to be bridged to other Subnets. The spoke contracts, each of which has a single specified hub contract, live on other Subnets that want to import the asset bridged by their specified hub. The token bridges are designed to be permissionless: anyone can register compatible spoke instances to allow for bridging tokens from the hub instance to that new spoke. The hub contract keeps track of token balances bridged to each spoke instance, and it handles returning the original tokens back to the user when assets are bridged back to the hub instance. Spoke instances are registered with their hub contract via a Teleporter message upon creation.

Hub contract instances specify the asset to be bridged as either an ERC20 token or the native token, and they allow for transferring the token to any registered spoke instances. The token representation on the spoke chain can also either be an ERC20 or native token, allowing users to have any combination of ERC20 and native tokens between hub and spoke chains:

- `ERC20` -> `ERC20`
- `ERC20` -> `Native`
- `Native` -> `ERC20`
- `Native` -> `Native`

The spoke tokens are designed to have compatibility with the token bridge on the hub chain by default, and they allow custom logic to be implemented in addition. For example, developers can inherit and extend the `ERC20TokenSpoke` contract to add additional functionality, such as a custom minting, burning, or transfer logic.
