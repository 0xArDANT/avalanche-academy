Using well-audited implementations of standards such as ERC-20 from reputable libraries like OpenZeppelin is generally a good choice in smart contract development. These libraries have undergone extensive security audits and rigorous testing, making them a reliable foundation for building decentralized applications and tokens.

Leveraging such battle-tested implementations not only helps developers save time and effort but also significantly reduces the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities into their contracts. By relying on widely adopted standards and well-vetted code, developers can benefit from the collective wisdom and experience of the blockchain community, enhancing the overall security and reliability of their projects while allowing them to focus on the unique features and functionalities of their smart contracts.
