Solidity does not automatically check for integer overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Developers should use safe math libraries to prevent these issues.


## What you will learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- Attack Mechanisms: How overflow and underflow attacks work.
- Exploiting the vulnerability: We will provide a vulnerable contract that you can exploit
- Countermeasures: You will how exploits of these vulnerabilities can be prevented
- Fixing the vulnerability: You will now fix the vulnerable contract
