Avalanche Consensus is a novel consensus protocol that is used in the Avalanche network. It is a leaderless, decentralized, and scalable consensus protocol that is used to achieve consensus on the state of the network.

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- **Consensus Mechanisms:** Understand what consensus mechanisms are and how they work
- **Snowman Consensus:** Learn about the Snowman consensus protocol
- **TPS vs TTF:** Understand the difference between transactions per second (TPS) and time to finality (TTF)
