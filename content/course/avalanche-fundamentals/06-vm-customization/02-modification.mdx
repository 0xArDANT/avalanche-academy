The next more powerful way to customize a VM is VM Modification. To meet our requirements, we can modify and extend our existing VM. In our soda dispenser analogy, we might want to customize our soda dispenser to accept card payments. Our current soda dispenser machine simply does not have this feature. Instead of reinventing the wheel and building a new dispenser with the new feature from the ground up, we simply extend the existing VM using a plugin.

In Avalanche, creating modified VMs is straightforward. The subnetEVM for instance can be customized through the development of plugins as well as precompiles.
