A Subnet is a network with its own set of rules regarding membership, token economics, and execution layer. It is composed of a Subset of Avalanche validators collaborating to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Validators can be members of numerous Subnets.

Avalanche enables multiple interconnected Subnets. Each Subnet is independent while maintaining the capacity to communicate with other Subnets. All validators are part of the Subnet known as the Primary Network.

Each blockchain belongs to exactly one Subnet, but a Subnet can validate many blockchains. Each blockchain can define its own Virtual Machine (EVM, customized EVM or entirely new VM). 

The tailored, application-specific blockchains of Subnets offer a solution to these challenges and many others, moving away from the monolithic blockchain structure of the past.
