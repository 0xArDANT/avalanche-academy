The Native Minter precompile allows an specific address to mint native tokens. This precompile is an Allow List enabled precompiled contract, so it will require to designate some admin address that can be taken from an initial configuration from genesis/upgrade.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "contractNativeMinterConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Interacting with the NativeMinter from Solidity

The Stateful Precompile contract powering the ContractNativeMinter adheres to the following Solidity interface at 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001 :

```solidity
// (c) 2022-2023, Ava Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.
// See the file LICENSE for licensing terms.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "./IAllowList.sol";

interface INativeMinter is IAllowList {
  event NativeCoinMinted(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount
  );

  // Mint [amount] number of native coins and send to [addr]
  function mintNativeCoin(address addr, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

mintNativeCoin takes an address and amount of native coins to be minted. The amount denotes the amount in minimum denomination of native coins (10^18). For example, if you want to mint 1 native coin (in AVAX), you need to pass 1 * 10^18 as the amount. A NativeCoinMinted event is emitted with the sender, recipient and amount when a native coin is minted.
